Ever wondered what it takes to turn tricky technical challenges into reliable, high-performing web applications that users love?

Allō! 👋🏻 I’m a Montreal-based French Software Development Engineer and Technical Lead with over 10 years of experience crafting efficient, user-friendly, and accessible web applications. From optimizing performance and developing APIs to automating tests and integrating third-party tools, I bring thoughtful design and architecture to every project.

Complex challenges, puzzling bugs, and system improvements are where I thrive. Past projects have increased application speed, made the web more inclusive, and delivered measurable results that matter to businesses and users alike–the important stuff, you know.

Collaboration drives my work. Open communication, teamwork, and continuous learning create thriving teams, and I’m dedicated to fostering that kind of positive environment. Whether mentoring team members, working with stakeholders, or refining workflows, I focus on making the process both productive and enjoyable.

Staying curious keeps me sharp, whether exploring new technologies, refining leadership skills, or contributing to open-source projects to share knowledge. And if there’s room for a terrible developer joke along the way, even better.

Let’s connect! ✨ I’d love to help bring your next idea to life with a creative, practical approach—and maybe a laugh or two.
